# Rialight

This framework has not began yet and it'll be restarted. One time I may continue it. I'm keeping the `src` directory temporarily.

This framework will only require you to know the `std` API other than its own API, allowing you to create graphical applications for any purpose with no boilerplate configuration required, eliminating use of additional crates and using features that can be turned on and off. This project is not active in the moment and I will refactor everything once I get back to it.

Rialight will be similiar to Adobe AIR and Godot Engine.
